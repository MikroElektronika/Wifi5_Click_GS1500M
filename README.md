WiFi 5 click™ is a mikroBUS™ add-on board with Gainspan’s GS1500M ultra low-power Wi-Fi module with a PCB trace antenna (external IPX antenna connector also available). GS1500M supports Wi-Fi PHY speeds of up to 72.2mbps. The module is fully compliant with both IEEE 802.11b/g/n as well as with the requirements of the Wi-Fi alliance. Security features include support for WEP/WPA/WPA2, Adhoc and WPS (Wi-Fi protected setup). On the hardware side, the GS1500M module comprises two ARM7 44MHz chips (one for the radio, the other for applications), as well as on-chip Flash and SRAM. WiFi 5 click communicates with the target MCU through the mikroBUS™ UART interface (TX, RX), with additional functionality provided by RST and Prog pins (the latter in place of default mikroBUS™ AN pin).
